Connect your phone to this WiFi network then go to recboxgames.com/play
on your phone (use chrome for best experience).

To play, first split your group into two teams: Red vs Blue. Each team must
pick a clue giver. Only the clue givers know which chests contain swords 
(those are the good ones!) and which chests contain bombs (avoid those!). 

On your team’s turn, your clue giver must give a single word as a clue to
which chests the guessers should pick and determine how many chests your
team must open. Guess right and you’ll do damage to the enemy team, but
guess wrong and you could hurt your own team. Openning the wrong chest
does not end your team's turn.

Why does Blue Team start with more health? Because Red Team attacks first!

A full tutorial is in development. For now ask the GameNite Team for help.
